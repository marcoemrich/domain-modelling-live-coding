Meet with Tasting-Organizer

 * greetings, establish roles
 * brings wine -> dev tries, but dont like, says "tastes awsome" with bad face
 * explain background/business model (rember me, I forgot everything, explain it like I know nothing and there would be 200 people watching who would like to understand it as well)
   * Wine Tastings as business model
   * some payed or sponsored by the winemaker, it's only their wine then
   * only general notion   
 * we did this eventstorming, can you refresh my memory again

 * dev explains the why we doing this in the code
  * more accurate, less ambiguous
  * we do it in a way that is understandable, you don't need coding skills to understand (only to write)
  * you can actually verify the code
  * the code becomes like a contract between PO and dev

Rules
